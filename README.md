# centos7-dev
Just a Dockerfile to create a CentOS 7 image with all packages needed to build Broadcom wireless kernel modules, as described in the [CentOS Wiki](http://wiki.centos.org/HowTos/Laptops/Wireless/Broadcom). 
[Here is a shell script](https://gist.github.com/ThoMo/e11e4c5216229cdc5976) which use the container to build the kernel module.
